//Subtraction:

let n3 = 5
let n4 = 4

console.log(`Subtraction ${n3-n4}`)

//Multiplication:

let n5 = 2
let n6 = 3

console.log(`multiplication ${n5*n6}`)

//Division:

let n7 = 8
let n8 = 2

console.log(`Division ${n7/n8}`)
  

console.log(`Addition ${n1+n2}
 Subtraction ${n3-n4}
  Multiplication ${n5*n6}
   Division ${n7/n8}`)
