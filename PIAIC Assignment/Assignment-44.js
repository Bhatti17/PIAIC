/* Cars: Write a function that stores information about
a car in a Object. The function should always receive a
 manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an
  arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
  with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
   such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s
    returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly. */

function createCar(manufacturer, modelName, ...options) {
